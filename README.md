# anomaly-detection-dashcam-i3d
Fine-tuning of pretrained Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) models for anomaly detection in dashcam videos. This repository adapts pretrained weights to detect abnormal driving events (e.g., accidents, sudden stops, unexpected objects) through transfer learning on road scene datasets.
